# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

A simple GUI that lets the user compute simple arithmetic in [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a mathematical notation wherein every operator follows all of its
operands. For example, if we want to add 3 and 4, we write 3 4 +

Our Reverse Polish Calculator allows us to click 3 (and we see 3 in the display), then 4
(and we see 4), and then +, which performs the calculation and shows the result 7 on the display. Keep in mind that when
subtracting, the first number will be subtracted from the first.
